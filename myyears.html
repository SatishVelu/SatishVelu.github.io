						I see myself operating a well-run business in order to invest in a better and cleaner future for Earth. It is important that the future generations get an equal opportunity as us
						to be able to take in and enjoy Earth. In order to reach this goal, my first step is to learn how a business operates and make connections with powerful people. Then I will accumulate
						wealth to invest in and build technology that will be cost efficient to promote the usage of clean and safe energy.
					</p>
					<p align="center">
						While it is important for me to accomplish this overwhelming and nearly impossible goal; I will also pursue my own hobbies and interests. I will continue to play and
						dedicate some time to ultimate frisbee. Another hobby I'm currently picking up is playing guitar, and would like to move into the advanced level to be able to make my own music. Of course 
						how can I forget my goal of traveling to every single country on the planet. <img src="smile.png" alt="smiley face" width="15" height="15">
