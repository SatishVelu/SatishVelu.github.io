						Welcome! I am currently a sophomore majoring in Industrial Distribution at Texas A&M University.
						I chose to go to Texas A&M because of the welcoming and family-like environment as well as the extraordinary
						Aggie Network. My expected graduation from Texas A&M is in May of 2021. By the time I graduate I hope to have fostered the necessary skills to make an
						everlasting impact on the world and be able to start my own company to research and push usage of clean and renewable energy.
					</p>
					<p>
						I currently play for the A&M Ulimate Frisbee Sports Club. I'am greatful to be able to play the sport
						and not be injured so far <img src="thanks.png" alt="thank you" width="15" height="15">. Ultimate has taught me many valuable skills I would need in the workforce: communication, team mentality, 
						and leadership. This has been the most impactful sport I've played thus far in my life, and I will make the effort to play even after graduation.
					</p>
					<p>
						While I do like to play sports I also like spending some nice at-home time. I'm a avid watcher of vines and late night show recordings on YouTube. I also like to go on roadtrips,
						shopping, and to eat out with friends (go <a href="http://www.pluckers.com/">pluckers!</a>). Thank you for spending your time on my website and I will keep updating it, feel free to
						come back! <img src="smile.png" alt="smiley face" width="15" height="15">
